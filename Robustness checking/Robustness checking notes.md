#Note on robustness checks
Log income vs Followers - this is a scatterplot of the log of income (continuous) against followers (clipped at 50,000 to remove outliers). This replicates graph 1 in the main paper but checks robustness by not using the arbitrary income bands and using the measure continuously. It shows the same positive effect for size with larger organisations generally having high follower counts.

Log assets vs Followers – this is the same as the log income graph but using the log of assets for each charity. This is a different proxy for the measure of size and shows the same positive size effect. It was not possible to use staff numbers due to high rates of missing data in our dataset.

Robustness table - Table 2 with percentile groups rather than NCVO boundaries – this is a replica of table 2 but with the charities split into four brackets based on percentiles of the income distribution rather than the NCVOs boundaries.
