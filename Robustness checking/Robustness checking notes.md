#Note on robustness checks
Log income vs Twitter metrics - this is a graph of the log of income (continuous) against following, followers, and tweets. This replicates graph 1 in the main paper but checks robustness by not using the arbitrary income bands and using the measure continuously. It shows the same null effect for following and the same increase in followers and tweets as income increases. There are large peaks and troughs, but the overall trend is upwards as income increases.

Log assets vs Twitter metrics – this is the same as the log income graph but using the log of total assets for each charity. This is a different proxy for the measure of size and shows the same pattern. It was not possible to use staff numbers due to high rates of missing data in our dataset.

Table 2 with percentile groups rather than NCVO boundaries – this is a replica of table 2 but with the charities split into four brackets based on percentiles of the income distribution rather than the NCVOs boundaries.

Table 1 and 2 with 30 handles rather than 40 – these are exact replicas of table 1 and 2 from the main paper but with groups of 30 handles rather than 40. This was achieved by dropping 10 handles from each group and rerunning the analysis. The results are very similar, with some variations but no effects or directions changing. This was a robustness check of the size of the groupings.
